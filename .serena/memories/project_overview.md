# Vibe Coding Notes - Project Overview

## Project Purpose
This is a personal development workspace containing two main components:

1. **Agents Database** - A comprehensive collection of specialized AI agents designed for rapid development workflows. These agents cover all aspects of software development including engineering, design, marketing, product management, and testing.

2. **Vibe-Coding Website** - A personal single-page application for tracking daily coding notes, MCP tools, best practices, and workflow insights. Built using the agents from the database in a structured 3-phase development workflow.

## Key Project Goals
- Accelerate development through specialized AI agents
- Track personal coding progress and insights
- Demonstrate structured AI agent collaboration workflows
- Provide reusable templates for rapid prototyping
